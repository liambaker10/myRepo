# Read in a file
# use the keyword with to handle connecting to the file system
# The example reads in the file movies.txt and stores it in the variable file
# Use a for loop to iterate through the file line by line
# use strip() to strip off the new line that's read
with open('movies.txt') as file:

# This example reads in heights.txt 
# It strips the new line off of each line
# The split() function separates each space separated word into an item in an array
# values will hold ['firstname','lastname',height]
# It then concatenates the first and last name and uses the full name as the key 
# into the dictionary height and stores the height as the value.
